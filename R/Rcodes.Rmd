## Modifications on {forester}

We changed and expanded some functions of the forester package. You can see the reasons for this action below:

* The forester returns the predicted labels, we changed this with predicted probabilities to calculate the performance metrics which are based on probabilities such as log-loss, Brier score and MCC.

* The forester returns only the output of the best performing model in terms of the value of intended metric, we expanded it to return the output of all models for comparing their performance with the additional metrics.

* After under-sample the dataset, the ranger changes the reference class in the model and causes a inconsistency. Thus, we add an argument to the make_ranger and forester functions to control the reference class.

We use the forester `forester` AutoML tool to train various tree-based classification models from `XGBoost`, `randomForest`, `LightGBM`, and `CatBoost` libraries.

```{r}
# training tree-based models on original dataset
set.seed(123)
original_model <- forester(data   = train_data,
                           target = "status",
                           type   = "classification")

# training tree-based models on under-sampled dataset
set.seed(123)
under_model <- forester(data    = under_train_data$data,
                        target  = "status",
                        type    = "classification",
                        refclass = "")

# training tree-based models on over-sampled dataset
set.seed(123)
over_model <- forester(data   = over_train_data$data,
                       target = "status",
                       type   = "classification")
```

dataset %>%

            nshot  = length(match_id),         # number of shots
            mshot  = nshot / nmatch,           # mean of shots per match
            ngoal  = sum(result == "Goal"),    # number of goals
            mgoal  = ngoal / nmatch,           # mean of goals per match
            conv   = ngoal / nshot * 100)      # convertion percent of the shots to goal
